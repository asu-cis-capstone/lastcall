In order to track our progress throughout the semester we will use two key metrics: Customer interviews, and design prototype iteration. 

Using the baseline model that has been created we will improve upon the design based on customer feedback we recieve. We will look to
gain highly interested individuals which could lead to the development of a working prototype and product for testing.
