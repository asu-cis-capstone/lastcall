(Drink Up)
Our app allows Bars to send push notifications through our app to anyone utilizing the app to drive up patron traffic to the bar. 
Also it allows the users of the app to receive notifications within a predetermined search field on any new specials going on. 
Our app allows businesses to not only advertise on our app, but to get back real-time data that shows them who has entered the bar 
because of their push notification. This allows our customers to see if their advertising is being effective, what specials seem to 
work best at drawing in customers, what days& times are effective to advertise in, all in real-time.
